My Calculator Application 
===========================

-> Mainly used to calculate the final result of an arithmetic expression.
-> Used concepts -- OOPs(Inheritance), Collection(Queue, LinkedList), Interface & multiple classes.

 App flow 
 =========
 -> Initially the user need to enter an expression which contains arithmetic operators.
 -> This input is read by ReadExpression class using Scanner class and saved as a String variable.
 -> These inputs are filtered into operators and numbers in the MainApp class. 
    -> The string variable is converted into operator array & number array by split method. 
    -> These arrays are converted into LinkedList with Arrays.asList().
    -> Finally LinkedList variables are stored as a type of Queue.
    -> Using poll() we are fetching the first element of the queue and saved into a string variable.
    -> The string variable need to parse into Double for right calculation.
    -> We use do while loop as a outer loop to keep the flow of app without any break.
    -> We use while loop to iterate the calculation of expression.
    -> Inside while loop, we make use of Switch statement to categorize arithmetic operators.
    -> Based on the operator selection objects of respective operator class is created and using 
    dynamic binding we are storing the global object reference as a type of the interface.
    -> Interface method is implemented in all the operator class and overridden the functionality.
    -> Interface method is using "VARIABLE ARGUMENTS or VARRAGS" as method argument so that, the 
    method call can have required number of arguments without any restrictions.
    
    Note: In case of Varrags -- In the method definition those arguments are converted into 
    array of values.
